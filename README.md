# epublish

two helpful Kindle files

When publishing for Kindle, there are two essential files.  The table of contents file has a few special Amazon tags.   The navigation file connects the table of contents to the Kindle's drop down navigation bar.  

navigation.nav
toc.html

there are three books.  Note that the .nav file differs only in author and title.
